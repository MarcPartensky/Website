### 1)	In one typed paragraph, summarize in good grammatical sentences the ideal and the real production and recycle/disposal cycle of plastic, including the facts and figures. It must be ready to share your answer on the Chat with your classmates and I.
The ideal plastic cycle: first the plastic is produced, then it is used and reused. If we break the plastic, we repair it. If we can't repair it, we recycle it.
In reality there is no real cycle for plastic. In fact, considering the 78 billion tons of plastic produced for packaging, 2% of the plastic is recycled, 40% goes to landfill and 32% goes into nature.

### 2)	In one typed paragraph, summarize the advantages of plastic in good grammatical sentences.

Finally of course it can be reusable even though most of it isn't recycled the way it should.

### 10)	Describe the paradigm shift in Geoff Norby’s business thinking?

It is also questionable whether the environment in which companies and employees evolve is good in the long term.
